"0. Set register 1 to 123."
[n, 123, 0, 0, 0]
"1. binary AND register 1 and 456, save result in register 1."
[n, 72, 0, 0, 0]
"2. Is register 1 == 72? Save result in register 1."
[n, 1, 0, 0, 0]
"3. add register 1 and register 4, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"4. Set register 4 to 0. This effects the pointer"
"5. Set register 1 to 0."
"6. binary OR register 1 and 65536, save result in register 5."
"7. Set register 1 to 8586263."
"8. binary AND register 5 and 255, save result in register 2."
"9. add register 1 and register 2, save result in register 1."
"10. binary AND register 1 and 16777215, save result in register 1."
"11. multiply register 1 and 65899, save result in register 1."
"12. binary AND register 1 and 16777215, save result in register 1."
"13. Is 256 > register 5? Save result in register 2."
"14. add register 2 and register 4, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"15. add register 4 and 1, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"16. Set register 4 to 27. This effects the pointer"
"17. Set register 2 to 0."
"18. add register 2 and 1, save result in register 3."
"19. multiply register 3 and 256, save result in register 3."
"20. Is register 3 > register 5? Save result in register 3."
"21. add register 3 and register 4, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"22. add register 4 and 1, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"23. Set register 4 to 25. This effects the pointer"
"24. add register 2 and 1, save result in register 2."
"25. Set register 4 to 17. This effects the pointer"
"26. Set register 5 to the value of register 2."
"27. Set register 4 to 7. This effects the pointer"
"28. Is register 1 == register 0? Save result in register 2."
"29. add register 2 and register 4, save result in register 4. This effects the pointer"
"30. Set register 4 to 5. This effects the pointer"

So I can enter [n, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
And I'm trying to find out the n such that reg[4] > 30 earliest
